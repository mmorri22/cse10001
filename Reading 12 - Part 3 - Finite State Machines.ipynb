    "# Reading 12: Part 3 - Finite State Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, using a direct set of <i>input to output</i> signals is insufficient to solve the problem. Consider the case of a vending machine. Vending machine use small <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system\">embedded systems</a> to keep track of how much money you have dispensed, and when to vend specific items. For example, if we have paid <b>1.00</b> and we enter a quarter, there are different results if we are purchasing an item that is <b>1.75</b>, <b>1.25</b>, or <b>1.00</b>. Coding the result for each individual item takes up a lot of space on the limited embedded machine. We can do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write digital logic that acts like a graph called a <b>Finite State Machine</b>. A <b>Finite State Machine</b> consists of:<br />\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>A set of states (represented as nodes)</li>\n",
    "    <li>An initial state</li>\n",
    "    <li>A set of transitions between states (represented by edges)</li>\n",
    "    <li>A set of control input signals</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a simple mechanism that can be modeled by a state machine is a turnstile. A turnstile, used to control access to subways and amusement park rides, is a gate with three rotating arms at waist height, one across the entryway. Initially the arms are locked, blocking the entry, preventing patrons from passing through. Depositing a coin or token in a slot on the turnstile unlocks the arms, allowing a single customer to push through. After the customer passes through, the arms are locked again until another coin is inserted.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The turnstile has two possible states: <b>Locked</b> and <b>Unlocked</b>. There are two possible inputs that affect its state: putting a coin in the slot (<b>coin</b>) and pushing the arm (<b>push</b>). In the locked state, pushing on the arm has no effect; no matter how many times the input <b>push</b> is given, it stays in the locked state. Putting a <b>coin</b> in <i>shifts the state</i> from Locked to Unlocked. In the unlocked state, putting additional coins in has no effect; that is, giving additional coin inputs does not change the state. However, a customer pushing through the arms, giving a push input, shifts the state back to Locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the image below: The format is <code>state_name / output</code>. For example, any time you reach the state <code>q0</code>, the output will be a <code>0</code>. Conversely, any time you reach the state <code>q3</code>, the output will be a <code>0</code>.\n",
