<!-- HTML Example -->
<!-- 1 - Put the html tag here -->
    
    <!-- 2 - Put the head tag here -->

    <!-- Ignore the other three comments initially. We will come back here for Background Colors! -->
    <!-- 13 (continued) - ND Official Green is #00843D -->
    <!-- body bgcolor="#00843D">
    <!-- To make it easier on the eyes, we will do Cyan 00FFFF -->

        
        <!-- 4 - We will start Hello, World here -->

		<!-- 5 - Now we do a h2 header to see the difference -->

        <!-- 6 - Here is where you can format your code in several ways -->
        <!-- The p tag denotes a new paragraph -->
        <!-- em or i are used for italics, and strong or b are used for bold -->

        
		<!-- 7 - Now we will add an image -->
        <!-- Pupfessor image source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmorri22/cse10001/main/PupfessorEirinn.jpg-->
        <!-- You can center the image using the center tag -->
        <!-- Adding title im image src allows for hovering text -->
        
    
        
        <!-- 8 - Now we can manipulate images. Add the following to the image: , width="50%", height="200%" -->
        <!-- Then replace with the 50% and 200% reversed: , width="50%", height="200%" -->
        <!-- Getting rid of the percentages and quotes puts them by pixel: , width=100, height=200 -->
        <!-- The original image is 162x169, so I will double it using: , width=324, height=338 -->
        
        <!-- 9 - You can add a line using hr / -->
        
        
        <!-- 10 - You can add code examples (not actual running code yet) to your website, which can remove UNICODE characters -->
        
       
        <!-- Use tab to represent a code segment, and br / for each new line -->

    
    
        <!-- Add a paragraph break <br /> -->
        
        <!-- Add a line <hr /> -->
        
        <!-- 11 - Now let's learn how to link to other web pages -->
        <!-- My example link will be: https://www.instagram.com/EirinnNDPupfessor/ -->
        
    
        
        <!-- 12 - We can also use images as hyper links -->
        <!-- We will use the following: <img src = "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:pnp:highsm:18600:18695/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", width=306, height=225> -->
        <!-- We will also learn how to make text different colors! -->
        <!-- Combining Concepts: ND's Blue is 12, 35, 64 and Gold is 201, 151, 0. What are the Hex Values? -->
		<!-- 13 - After showing the students this, go to the body and manipulate the background -->
        
    
    
        
        <!-- 14 - Add a line <hr /> -->
        
        <!-- 15 - Here, we will make a list of items, where HTML will number the list for us -->
		<!-- We will put <h2>Making a list</h2> -->
        
    
    
    
    
        
        
        <!-- 16 - Let's also organize information into basic tables! -->
        <!-- Quick Note: When we get to CSS next lecture, we will add borders and the like -->

    

        <!-- 17 - We will conclude this lecture with a Form Example -->
        <!-- Preview for next week, how to we actually *save and use* this information as variables? -->
